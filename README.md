## Self-evaluation
We set out to create a racing simulator game that involved both hardware and software, which we were able to accomplish with the steering, pedal, and graphics. We had 3 stretch goals and were able to meet one of them, obstacle generation. Working on the project the night before the due date is a memory we all will remember. It felt like a hackathon with all of three of us working to bring the game to life. We went from just a black road on a deep blue background to the full game swiftly and we all agree that it was a great experience to work on the project with one another! We are proud of the steering wheel and pedal integration and how we were able to layer the graphics to respond to those inputs accordingly.
